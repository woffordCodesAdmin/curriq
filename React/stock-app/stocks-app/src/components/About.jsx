      <h3>Stocks:</h3>
      <p>
        There are two main kinds of stocks, common stock and preferred stock.
        Common stock entitles owners to vote at shareholder meetings and receive
        dividends. Preferred stockholders usually don’t have voting rights but
        they receive dividend payments before common stockholders do, and have
        priority over common stockholders if the company goes bankrupt and its
        assets are liquidated. Common and preferred stocks may fall into one or
        more of the following categories: Growth stocks have earnings growing at
        a faster rate than the market average. They rarely pay dividends and
        investors buy them in the hope of capital appreciation. A start-up
        technology company is likely to be a growth stock. Income stocks pay
        dividends consistently. Investors buy them for the income they generate.
        An established utility company is likely to be an income stock. Value
        stocks have a low price-to-earnings (PE) ratio, meaning they are cheaper
        to buy than stocks with a higher PE. Value stocks may be growth or
        income stocks, and their low PE ratio may reflect the fact that they
        have fallen out of favor with investors for some reason. People buy
        value stocks in the hope that the market has overreacted and that the
        stock’s price will rebound. Blue-chip stocks are shares in large,
        well-known companies with a solid history of growth. They generally pay
        dividends. Another way to categorize stocks is by the size of the
        company, as shown in its market capitalization. There are large-cap,
        mid-cap, and small-cap stocks. Shares in very small companies are
        sometimes called “microcap” stocks. The very lowest priced stocks are
        known as “penny stocks.” These companies may have little or no earnings.
        Penny stocks do not pay dividends and are highly speculative. What are
        the benefits and risks of stocks? Stocks offer investors the greatest
        potential for growth (capital appreciation) over the long haul.
        Investors willing to stick with stocks over long periods of time, say 15
        years, generally have been rewarded with strong, positive returns. But
        stock prices move down as well as up. There’s no guarantee that the
        company whose stock you hold will grow and do well, so you can lose
        money you invest in stocks. If a company goes bankrupt and its assets
        are liquidated, common stockholders are the last in line to share in the
        proceeds. The company’s bondholders will be paid first, then holders of
        preferred stock. If you are a common stockholder, you get whatever is
        left, which may be nothing. Even when companies aren’t in danger of
        failing, their stock price may fluctuate up or down. Large company
        stocks as a group, for example, have lost money on average about one out
        of every three years. If you have to sell shares on a day when the stock
        price is below the price you paid for the shares, you will lose money on
        the sale. Market fluctuations can be unnerving to some investors. A
        stock’s price can be affected by factors inside the company, such as a
        faulty product, or by events the company has no control over, such as
        political or market events. Stocks usually are one part of an investor’s
        holdings. If you are young and saving for a long-term goal such as
        retirement, you may want to hold more stocks than bonds. Investors
        nearing or in retirement may want to hold more bonds than stocks. The
        risks of stock holdings can be offset in part by investing in a number
        of different stocks. Investing in other kinds of assets that are not
        stocks, such as bonds, is another way to offset some of the risks of
        owning stocks.
